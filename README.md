# Printer Simulation

This project is a **multithreaded printer simulation** where multiple users (threads) attempt to print documents using a shared printer resource.  
It demonstrates **thread synchronization**, **`wait()`/`notify()` usage**, and **safe resource sharing** in Java.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- `Printer.java` â€” handles printing logic and synchronizes access to the printer.
- `User.java` â€” represents a user that requests printing through a separate thread.
- `Processing.java` â€” simulates the document preparation and printing delay.
- `Main.java` â€” creates users, starts threads, and ensures all printing operations complete.

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Create a folder named `printer` in your project directory.
2. Place the following files into the `printer` folder:
   - `Main.java`
   - `Printer.java`
   - `User.java`
   - `Processing.java`
3. Ensure that each file has the `package printer;` declaration at the top.
4. Compile and run the `Main.java` file.

```bash
javac printer/*.java
java printer.Main
```
