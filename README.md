# Printer Simulation

This project is a **multithreaded printer simulation** where multiple users (threads) attempt to print documents using a shared printer resource.  
It demonstrates **thread synchronization**, **`wait()`/`notify()` usage**, and **safe resource sharing** in Java.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- `Printer.java` â€” handles printing logic and synchronizes access to the printer.
- `User.java` â€” represents a user that requests printing through a separate thread.
- `Processing.java` â€” simulates the document preparation and printing delay.
- `Main.java` â€” creates users, starts threads, and ensures all printing operations complete.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Create a folder named `printer` in your project directory.
2. Place the following files into the `printer` folder:
   - `Main.java`
   - `Printer.java`
   - `User.java`
   - `Processing.java`
3. Ensure that each file has the `package printer;` declaration at the top.
4. Compile and run the `Main.java` file.

```bash
javac printer/*.java
java printer.Main
```

ðŸ“‹ Project Flow
Step 1: Users (threads) are created and started.

Step 2: Each user prepares its document (simulated with a delay).

Step 3: Threads synchronize access to the shared printer.

Step 4: If the printer is busy, a thread will wait.

Step 5: Once the printer is available, the thread prints its document.

Step 6: After printing, the next waiting thread is notified.

ðŸ›  Technical Details
Thread synchronization is handled using synchronized blocks and methods.

wait() is called if the printer is already busy.

notify() wakes up the next waiting thread after a print job finishes.

Join mechanism ensures that the Main thread waits until all documents are printed.

âš¡ Key Features
Proper use of Java's concurrency control (synchronized, wait(), notify()).

Clear separation of thread preparation and printer access.

Simulated realistic printing delays.

Safe shared resource usage among multiple threads.

âš  Important Notes
No real files are uploaded â€”
This project simulates file uploads and printing by printing messages and delay dots . in the console.
You do not need to manually place any actual document files inside the printer folder.

ðŸ’¡ Why is this a good GitHub project?
